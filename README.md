The air Bnb console is an invaluable project that is geared towards understanding 
how applications are built.
The console is built for easy manipulation of data using file storage.
The console is for easy serialization and deserialization of data

SERIALIZATION: This is the conversion of data structure to JSON (Javascript Object Notation) object.
DESERIALIZATION:This is the conversion of JSON object to data structrure
JSON : Coverting data to JSON is important as this data can be understood by other Languages

IMPORTANCE OF JSON
This project uses the python cmd module to invoke the Cmd class this class is used to take in data from the command line
process it and send the relevant output to the user

USEAGE:

How to use the Cmd class
we create a file call module_test.py
and from module_test.py import the cmd module
create a class of our choice and make it a subclass of the Cmd python class
Example: 
	
	class Test(cmd.Cmd):
		you can create class modules as commands
